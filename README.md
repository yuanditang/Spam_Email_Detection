## Overview

Email remains one of the most exploited vectors for cybercrime. Traditional spam filters‚Äîlike those in Gmail‚Äîstruggle to detect advanced phishing, Business Email Compromise (BEC), and socially engineered attacks.  

This project introduces a **browser-based email security extension** powered by a **hierarchical ensemble of specialized models**. Instead of flattening diverse threat datasets into a single classifier, we design **four specialized models** for different malicious content types (phishing, advance-fee fraud, malware, and BEC), orchestrated by a **meta-classifier**.  

We further integrate **explainable AI (XAI)** techniques‚Äîattention visualization, SHAP value analysis, and rule extraction‚Äîto help users understand why an email is classified as malicious. The ultimate goal: **improve both detection accuracy and user trust through transparency**.

---

## Key Research Questions

1. Do **type-specific models** outperform generic ‚Äúcatch-all‚Äù classifiers for email security?  
2. Can we extract **interpretable decision rules** from complex ML models that remain actionable to users?  
3. Do **explanatory interfaces** actually improve human decision-making when evaluating potential threats?

## Datasets

We leverage **seven complementary datasets** representing diverse threat types and eras of email attacks:

| Dataset | Focus | Notable Features |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| **Nazario Phishing Corpus** | Credential phishing | Classic phishing patterns (2004‚Äì2015) |
| **Nigerian Fraud Collections** | Advance-fee scams | Distinct narrative & linguistic patterns |
| **TREC Spam Track (05‚Äì07)** | Commercial spam | Real-world inbox data, nuanced labels |
| **EPVME** | Visual phishing | HTML/CSS obfuscation & image-based deception |
| **Bitabuse** | Crypto scams & ransomware | Emerging blockchain-related fraud |
| **Recent Phish Feeds (PhishTank, OpenPhish)** | Modern phishing (2023‚Äì2024) | AI-generated & COVID-themed scams |
| **Legitimate Business Emails (Enron + others)** | Non-malicious BEC-like emails | Executive tone, transaction discussions |

Each dataset is harmonized into a **hierarchical label taxonomy**, preserving distinctions like fraud subtypes and target brands.

## Architecture

Our **three-tier hierarchical ensemble** integrates efficiency, specialization, and interpretability:

1. **Tier 1 ‚Äì Gating Classifier (Logistic Regression)**  
   - Performs quick triage (legitimate / malicious / uncertain).  
   - Lightweight, interpretable, and computationally efficient.  

2. **Tier 2 ‚Äì Specialized Classifiers**  
   - **Phishing Detector:** DistilBERT fine-tuned on Nazario, EPVME, modern phishing.  
   - **Advance-Fee Fraud Detector:** XGBoost with TF-IDF on Nigerian fraud corpora.  
   - **Malware Detector:** Random Forest using structural + attachment features.  
   - **BEC Detector:** DistilBERT with contextual anomaly features (sender-recipient patterns, urgency language).  

3. **Tier 3 ‚Äì Meta-Classifier (Neural Attention Network)**  
   - Aggregates specialist outputs, weighting them via attention mechanisms.  
   - Produces a unified confidence score and interpretability layer.

## Explainability & User Interface

Our browser extension provides **multi-level interpretability**:

| Technique | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| **Attention Visualization** | Highlights key text phrases influencing classification |
| **SHAP Values** | Quantifies feature importance using game-theoretic contribution scores |
| **Rule Extraction (inTrees)** | Converts tree ensembles into human-readable IF‚ÄìTHEN rules |
| **Natural Language Explanations** | Converts technical output into plain-language insights |

### Browser Extension UI
- Simple threat badges (üü¢ Safe / üü° Suspicious / üî¥ Dangerous)  
- Expandable ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù section showing primary indicators  
- Optional advanced mode for technical users (attention maps, SHAP charts, rules)

## Preliminary Results

| Model | Dataset | F1 Score | Notes |
|--------|----------|----------|-------|
| Logistic Regression (baseline) | Nazario + TREC | 85.9% | Strong linear baseline |
| Unified DistilBERT | Mixed Phishing + Fraud | 89.2% | High phishing accuracy, low fraud recall |
| Specialist DistilBERT (Phishing) | Phishing only | **92.8%** | Focused semantic performance |
| Specialist XGBoost (Fraud) | Fraud only | **88.6%** | +7.2% improvement over unified model |

üß© **Key Insight:** Specialist models outperform unified classifiers, particularly on minority threat types.
